## Engineering Notebook Overview

### Definition
A team's Engineering Notebook is an **original work written and organized by students** on the team. It describes a team's Engineering Design Process over the course of their robotics season and is the document that Judges use to evaluate teams for judged awards.

### Purpose
- Practice writing skills and express ideas through drawing
- Create a chronological account of the team's use of the Engineering Design Process
- Document the work that led to strategy, design, robot, code, and gameplay
- Serve as a historical record of failures AND successes

### Format Options
Teams may use:
- Physical notebook from VEX Robotics
- Different form of physical notebook
- Digital Engineering Notebook (app or cloud-based service)
- VEX Digital Notebook Templates

**Important**: All notebooks are evaluated by Judges according to the **same award criteria and rubric**. Evaluations prioritize **content and clarity** over sophistication of presentation or notebook length.

## Engineering Notebook Rubric

### Rubric Structure
The rubric uses proficiency levels:
- **Expert** (4-5 points)
- **Proficient** (2-3 points)
- **Emerging** (0-1 points)

### Key Rubric Categories (EN1-EN10)

#### EN1 - Identify the Challenge
- Identify game and robot design challenges in detail at the start of each design process cycle
- Use words AND pictures
- State goals for accomplishing the challenge

#### EN2 - Student-Centered Policy
- Notebook must align with RECF's Student-Centered Policy and Code of Conduct
- Templates are acceptable tools but end goal is independent organization
- **Never acceptable for adults to contribute materially** to students' notebook
- Adult involvement (adding content, excessive guidance, "cleaning up", organizing) violates policy

#### EN3 - Academic Honesty
- Cite and credit sources of materials and ideas not their own
- Reference materials should be placed in appendix
- Students should not claim outside information as original work
- Misrepresentation violates RECF Code of Conduct

#### EN4 - Brainstorm Solutions
- List **three or more possible solutions** to the challenge
- Include labeled diagrams for each solution
- Explain why solution was selected through testing and/or decision matrix

#### EN5 - Build and Program Documentation
- Record the steps to build and program the solution
- Include enough detail that reader can:
  - Follow the logic used by team
  - **Recreate the robot design from documentation**

#### EN6 - Test and Record Results
- Record all steps to test the solution
- Include test results with measurable data
- Document both successes and failures

#### EN7 - Design Iterations
- Show design process is repeated multiple times
- Demonstrate improvement on design goal or robot/game performance
- Show clear progression through iterations

#### EN8 - Project Management
- Provide complete record of:
  - Team and project assignments
  - Team meeting notes (goals, decisions, accomplishments)
  - Resource constraints (time and materials)
- Design cycles should be easily identified

#### EN9 - Evidence of Sequential Documentation (5 points)
- Prove documentation was done **in sequence** with design process
- Examples of evidence:
  - Signed and dated entries written in ink (bound notebook)
  - Revision history from digital platforms
  - Timestamps and contributor names

#### EN10 - Appendices
- Organize and separate reference materials from main body
- Judges do NOT consider appendix content when determining rubric scores
- Appendices may be used for context only

## Notebook Classification Levels

### Fully Developed Notebooks
**Characteristics:**
- Great detail throughout
- Detailed drawings
- Tests and test results
- Solutions to problems encountered
- Complete record of design process

**Minimum Requirement:**
- Score of 2+ points in first four rubric criteria
- Outlines single iteration of Engineering Design Process

**Award Eligibility:**
- **Only Fully Developed notebooks** should be considered for Innovate, Design, and Excellence Awards
- Roughly top 30% of Fully Developed notebooks considered for these awards

### Developing Notebooks
- Show progress toward full documentation
- May have gaps in some areas
- Not eligible for major awards

### Emerging Notebooks
- Basic documentation present
- Significant areas need improvement
- Early stage of development

---

## Critical Policies

### Student-Centered Policy
- **Adults CANNOT:**
  - Add content to notebook
  - Provide excessive guidance or direction
  - "Clean up" documentation
  - Organize notebook content
  - Edit the engineering notebook (read-only access acceptable)

### AI/LLM Policy
> "The use of artificial intelligence / large language model (AI/LLM) programs or tools to generate, organize, enhance, or alter Engineering Notebook content or programming code is **contrary to the RECF Student-Centered Policy and Code of Conduct**. Content produced by AI/LLM tools does not genuinely represent the skill level of a team."

**Clarification**: AI can be used for:
- Research and understanding concepts
- Learning best practices
- Reviewing structure and organization approaches
- **NOT** for generating actual notebook content

### Academic Honesty
- All outside sources must be cited
- Cannot claim others' work as original
- Violations can lead to removal from Judged Awards

---

## Interview Requirements

### General Requirements
- Teams **must complete an interview** to receive a Judged Award
- Robot and/or notebook may be present at interview
- Interview should NOT be a prepared recitation of notebook contents

### Interview Tips
- Judges want to see **specific roles identified**
- Demonstrates project management capabilities
- Shows use of human resources
- Teams can invent their own roles (example: "battery boy" was used by a Worlds Excellence Award winner)

### Time Limits
- Standardized time limit for each team
- Recommended: 10-20 minutes per notebook evaluation
- Higher age level events may require more time
