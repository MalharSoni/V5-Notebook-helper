## Community Guides & GitBooks

### IIWII Robotics Engineering Notebook Guide
**Link**: https://iiwii-robotics.gitbook.io/engineering-notebook

**Organization**: IIWII Robotics (7 years competition experience, 2 Design Awards at Worlds)

**Contents**:
- **VEX Engineering Notebooks Section**:
  - Notebooking best practices
  - Understanding the rubric and scoring system
  - Engineering Design Process (EDP) categories
  - Additional evaluation areas (innovation, usability, team management)
  - Notebook components (cover page, TOC, design brief, entries, appendix)
  - Entry types (general, meetings, time management, resource allocation, EDP-specific)
- **Interview Section**:
  - Interview preparation and tips
  - What judges look for

**Why It's Valuable**:
- Written by experienced, award-winning team
- Provides competitive perspective (not just official rules)
- Practical insights into what actually works
- Acknowledges that judges cannot provide feedback, so guide fills that gap

**Key Philosophy**: "One team/org's viewpoint" - recognizes multiple approaches can succeed

**How to Use**:
- Read alongside official RECF rubric
- Use for practical implementation guidance
- Reference when making decisions about notebook structure
- Compare your approach to their recommendations

**Distinction from Official Resources**: This is a competitive perspective, not an official RECF guide. It represents what has worked for this successful organization.

### Ascend Robotics Guide
**Link**: https://ascendrobotics.gitbook.io/ascend/vex-robotics/engineering-notebook/notebook-walkthrough

**Contents**:
- Section-by-section notebook walkthrough
- Design process guidance
- Comprehensive EDP implementation

**How to Use**: Reference for detailed section structure and content planning.

## AI Tools for Notebook Analysis

### VEX-Notebook-AI (GitHub Repository)
**Link**: https://github.com/VarunKurra/VEX-Notebook-AI
**Author**: Varun Kurra

**Description**: Streamlit application that uses AI to evaluate VEX engineering notebooks against official judging standards.

**Key Features**:
1. **PDF Analysis**: Upload notebook PDF for evaluation
2. **Official Standards Integration**: Uses official VEX judge guides and rubrics
3. **AI-Powered Feedback** (via Cohere API):
   - Identifies strengths and weaknesses
   - Provides feedback in official judging language
   - Offers recommendations for improvement
4. **Local Execution**: Runs on your machine via Streamlit (privacy-friendly)
5. **Extensible**: Modular design for future improvements

**How It Works**:
- Students upload their notebook PDF
- AI analyzes content against VEX rubric criteria
- Tool generates detailed assessment report
- Feedback mirrors actual judge evaluations

**Use Cases**:
- Pre-competition notebook review
- Identifying gaps in documentation
- Understanding how judges might evaluate your work
- Getting objective feedback before submission

**Important Compliance Note**:
This tool is for **ANALYSIS ONLY** - identifying what you have and what's missing. Per RECF Student-Centered Policy, you cannot use AI to generate, organize, enhance, or alter notebook content. Use this to understand gaps, then students must create the content themselves.

**Technical Requirements**:
- Python environment
- Streamlit
- Cohere API access
- PDF of your notebook

**Repository Value**:
- Open source - can review the code
- See how AI can be used for analysis (not generation)
- Learn what rubric criteria the tool checks
- Potential to extend or customize
