## Priority Actions (839Z Specific)

### Must Do (Before Next Competition)
1. Add brainstorming pages for 1 subsystem (3+ options)
2. Create decision matrix for that subsystem
3. Add strategy analysis page (7-8 strategies)
4. Label existing content as "Design Cycle 1"

### Should Do (Next Month)
- Brainstorming for all major subsystems
- Competition analysis after each event
- More programming documentation
- Add citations appendix

---

## Numbers to Remember

- **3+** design options per subsystem
- **7-8** strategies to analyze
- **Top 30%** of notebooks for Excellence
- **Top 40%** performance for Excellence
- **10-20 min** judges spend per notebook
- **5 points** for sequential documentation

---

## Red Flags (Avoid)

- Missing dates on pages
- No brainstorm alternatives shown
- "We just chose X" (no decision process)
- Only successes documented
- Copied content without citation
- Robot doesn't match documentation

---

## Green Flags (Do More)

- Show your thinking process
- Document failures and learning
- Quantify results (numbers!)
- Multiple complete design cycles
- All sources cited
- Authentic student voice
