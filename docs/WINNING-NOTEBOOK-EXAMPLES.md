## Key Takeaways

1. **Content > Presentation**: A beautiful notebook with poor content loses to a plain notebook with excellent content

2. **Process > Outcome**: Judges care more about HOW you got there than WHERE you ended up

3. **Failures Are Valuable**: Documenting what didn't work shows real engineering

4. **Be Authentic**: Student voice should be evident - over-polished can seem adult-assisted

5. **Interview Matches Notebook**: Students must be able to discuss any section

6. **Iterate Visibly**: Multiple design cycles clearly documented

7. **Quantify Everything**: Numbers > adjectives ("90% success rate" > "very reliable")
