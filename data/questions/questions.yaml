# Question selection strategies
question_strategies:
  start_easy:
    description: "Begin with general questions to make students comfortable"
    questions:
      - "Tell me about your robot."
      - "What was the most fun part of your season?"
      - "How did your team work together?"

  test_depth:
    description: "Probe for genuine understanding vs. memorization"
    techniques:
      - "Ask about specific page numbers or entries"
      - "Request elaboration on technical details"
      - "Ask 'why' questions about decisions"
      - "Request comparisons between options"

  verify_authenticity:
    description: "Confirm student-centered work"
    questions:
      - "Who wrote this section?"
      - "What were you thinking when you made this decision?"
      - "Did anything unexpected happen during this test?"

# Tips for students
student_tips:
  preparation:
    - "Know your notebook - any team member should be able to discuss any section"
    - "Practice explaining your design decisions, not just describing them"
    - "Be ready to discuss failures as well as successes"
    - "Don't memorize - understand the 'why' behind everything"

  during_interview:
    - "Be authentic and conversational, not rehearsed"
    - "It's okay to reference your notebook during the interview"
    - "Show enthusiasm for your work"
    - "If you don't know something, be honest"
    - "Connect your answers back to your engineering process"

  common_mistakes:
    - "Reciting notebook contents verbatim"
    - "Only one person answering all questions"
    - "Being unable to explain reasoning behind decisions"
    - "Not being familiar with all sections of notebook"
    - "Scripted or over-rehearsed responses"
